				<h2>About Christine:</h2>
                <p>Can you describe your early life and family background? Were there any events or people that notably influenced your formative years?
                
I hail from a single-parent home, having spent the first fiveâ€”in Massachusetts. My mother and I shared our lives there before we transitioned to Florida. The dynamics of my family during those times were rather tumultuous. Nevertheless, amidst the uncertainty, my mother stood out as an unwavering pillar of strength and loyalty. She profoundly impacted my early years and shaped much of who I am today.
               </p>
               <p>What are your passions or driving forces in life? How did you discover them?
At the core of my being, I'm profoundly passionate about mental health and the journey of self-growth. These passions were ignited by witnessing the repercussions of a fragmented family unit. Such experiences compelled me to embark on a mission: to aid others in their healing, to guide them through challenges akin to mine, and to nurture resilience within them.
               </p>
               <p>What have been some of the most significant challenges or obstacles you've faced? How did you overcome them, and what did you learn?
Some tough challenges I've grappled with include anger management, forgiveness, and navigating grief. Growing up, observing others in harmonious family setups starkly contrasted with my personal experiences. However, I've found healing and growth by leaning into my faith, fostering self-awareness, practicing deliberate self-care, setting boundaries, adopting healthy coping strategies, and seeking the guidance of a skilled therapist.
               </p>
               <p>What are some milestones or achievements you're particularly proud of? Can you describe the journey to reaching them?
Over time, I've marked significant achievements in mental health, mastering forgiveness, and refining self-regulation. Presently, I enjoy a life of fulfillment and happiness. Earning my master's in mental health counseling was pivotal, as was realizing and accepting my circumstances and discerning what I could evolve. Furthermore, I've also accomplished one of my dreams by launching my podcast.
               </p>
               <p>Are there any decisions or events in your life that you regret or wish you'd handled differently? What lessons did you learn from them?
My lingering regrets revolve around not seeking assistance earlier and inadvertently echoing my mother's mistakes. At that juncture, I lacked the skills and understanding to navigate better. I've gleaned vital insights from these episodes through introspection and embracing self-compassion.
               </p>
               <p>How would you describe your philosophy or outlook on life? Has this perspective changed over the years?
My philosophy centers on the belief that our reactions to life's events are within our control, and we aren't bound to be perpetual victims of our circumstances. This perspective has undergone a complete metamorphosis from my turbulent teenage and early adult years to my transformative 40s. I staunchly believe in our capacity to achieve anything as long as we set our minds to it.
               </p>
               <p>Who have been your life's most influential people or mentors? How have they shaped your path?
Undoubtedly, my mother has been a cornerstone in my life. I wouldn't be who I am today without the shared trials and lessons. Additionally, Sandy Nestor, a mentor, introduced me to the realm of mental health, kindling a passion within me. My faith in God has been a bedrock, seeing me through the darkest times. My husband has imparted invaluable lessons in patience and understanding. Last, my former therapist, Gina Fernandez, illuminated my path, teaching me to normalize my struggles.
               </p>
               <p>What are some dreams or aspirations you still have?
I aspire to complete my doctorate and establish my own practice.
               </p>
               <p>How do you want to be remembered? What impact do you hope to leave on the world or people around you?
I yearn to be memorialized as an individual deeply committed to the well-being of others. I want to leave a mark on this and future generations by addressing and alleviating mental health issues and ensuring healing is passed down.
               </p>
               <p>Looking back on your life, do you recognize themes or patterns? What advice would you give to your younger self?
Reflecting on my journey, I discern a recurring theme: a lingering feeling of inadequacy. I counsel my younger self to remember that emotions are fleeting. Difficult times are transient, and it's vital to persevere and push forward. 
               </p>
               <p>What are your favorite things to do leisurely?
As for leisure, I cherish moments spent with my husband, whether hiking, kayaking, outdoor activities, or even simple things like watching our favorite shows together.
