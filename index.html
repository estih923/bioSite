				<h2>Biography:</h2>
                <p>Christine's story began in Massachusetts, where she spent her early years with her mother. Navigating the ups and downs of a single-parent household, their life was anything but easy. But throughout every challenge, her mother emerged as the unwavering beacon of strength and guidance.

Given her firsthand experience with family challenges, it's unsurprising that Christine developed a profound passion for mental health and self-growth. Those personal trials shaped her character and paved her path toward a fulfilling career in mental health counseling. And her dedication didn't stop there; she also took a leap into the world of digital media, launching her own podcast.

Life, with its myriad challenges, has thrown Christine into the deep end more than once. Battles with anger, forgiveness, and grief have all been chapters in her story. Yet, with every obstacle, she's learned resilience and found strength. Integral to her journey was her remarkable therapist, Gina Fernandez, who proved to be a guiding star.

While her mother laid the foundation for Christine's values and strength, others significantly impacted her life. Sandy Nestor (friend, counselor, and psychologist) ignited her passion for mental health, and her unwavering faith became her anchor during the stormiest times. And then there's her husband, who consistently teaches her the beauty of patience and understanding.

She often enjoys outdoor activities, whether hiking, kayaking with her husband, or simply hanging out on the couch and watching their favorite shows. 

Peering into the future, Christine has dreams of a doctorate, and her own practice is on the horizon. She hopes to be remembered as someone who helps future generations find healing in mental health.
